# URL Shortener App Design

## Requirements:
1. Shorten URLs.
2. Redirect users to the original URL when a shortened URL is accessed.
3. Provide analytics on the number of times a shortened URL is accessed.
4. URLs should be unique and not collide.

## High-Level Design:
I would design the URL shortener app using a microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. The system would consist of the following components:

### 1. URL Shortening Service:
   - Accepts long URLs from users.
   - Generates a unique short code for each URL using a hashing algorithm.
   - Stores the mapping between short codes and original URLs in a database (key-value store for quick lookups).

### 2. Redirection Service:
   - Handles requests for shortened URLs.
   - Retrieves the original URL from the database using the short code.
   - Performs a 301 (permanent) redirect to the original URL.

### 3. Analytics Service:
   - Records each access to a shortened URL, storing relevant information such as timestamp and user IP address.
   - Provides analytics on URL access patterns.

### 4. Database:
   - A distributed and scalable database to store the mappings between short codes and original URLs.

### 5. User Interface:
   - A simple web interface or API for users to input long URLs and retrieve shortened ones.

## Detailed Design:

### 1. URL Shortening Service:
   - Use a hash function (like SHA-256) to generate a unique short code from the original URL.
   - Check the database to ensure that the short code is not already in use.
   - If a collision occurs, generate a new short code or append a counter to ensure uniqueness.
   - Store the mapping in the database.

### 2. Redirection Service:
   - Accepts requests with a short code.
   - Looks up the original URL in the database.
   - Performs a 301 redirect to the original URL.

### 3. Analytics Service:
   - Logs each access to a shortened URL.
   - Aggregates data for analytics purposes.
   - Provides a simple API for retrieving analytics data.

### 4. Database:
   - Use a distributed, scalable database like Cassandra, MongoDB, or DynamoDB to store the mappings.
   - Replicate data for fault tolerance and load balancing.

### 5. User Interface/API:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for shortening URLs.
   - Offers an API for programmatic access.

## Scalability and Reliability Considerations:
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming requests.
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed URLs.
   - Employ a distributed file system for storing analytics data.
   - Regularly back up data to ensure reliability.

## Security Considerations:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
   - Validate user input to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
