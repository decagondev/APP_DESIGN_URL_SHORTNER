# APP DESIGN URL SHORTNER
A Simple URL Shortner APP Design Repository to let learners go through the process of Systems Design Interviews

## Starter Notes (Design Steps)
To begin with, here is a list of possible steps for a systems design interview stage.
- Questioning / Information Gathering: In this stage you will be asking clarifying questions to **understand** the actual task.
- The Mind Map: In this stage you will map out your general thoughts and use this as the **understand** step of the process.
- Build the Design Board: This is the first step in the **plan** stage of the process.
- The Whimsical board thought-process design: In this step you would map out your thoughts visually.
- The Whimsical high-level infrastructure design: In this step you map out possible stack / technology in a high level overview
- The Whimsical database schema: In this step you would outline any tables that you might need for your application.
- The Whimsical service design: In this step you will map out some business logic you might need.
- The Whimsical API endpoints: In this step you will map out external and internal endpoints that utilize the services you have designed.
- The Whimsical middleware design: In this step you will add any designs for middleware you might use that you have not already outlined in other steps.
- The Whimsical front-end design: This is a medium to high level design of what the front end might look like, as in flow and general views.
- At this point you can start mocking out some of the database schema and api service and endpoints in your language of choice. This is very rudimentary pseudo-code for each of the moving parts. This will be the start of the **Execute** phase of the design.
- The next phase will be realizing the pseudo-code as actual code in an initial mock-up of the design.
