# APP DESIGN URL SHORTNER
A Simple URL Shortner APP Design Repository to let learners go through the process of Systems Design Interviews

## Strter Notes (Design Steps)
To begin with here is a list of possible steps for a systems design interview stage.
- The Questioning / Information Gathering (In this stage you will be asking clarifying questions to **understand** the actual task)
- the Mind Map (In this stage you will map out your general thoughts and use this as teh Understand Step of the process)
- Build the Design Board (This is the first step in the **Plan** stage of the process)
- The Whimsical board thought process design (In this step you would map out your thoughts visually)
- The Whimsical High Level infrastructure Design (In this step you map out possible stack / technology in a high level overview)
- The Whimsical Database Schema (In this step you would outline any tables that you might need for your application)
- The Whimsical Service Design (In this step you will map out some business ligic you might need)
- The Whimsical API Endpoints (In this step you will map out external and internal endpoints that utilize the services you have designed)
- The Whimsical Middleware Design (In this step you will add any designs for middleware you might use that you have not already outlined in other steps)
- The Whimsical Front End Design (This is a medium to high level design ofr what the front end might look like as in flow and general views)
- At this point you can start mocking out some of the database schema and api service and endpoints in your language of choice (This is a very rudimentary code of each moving part as seperate parts not an overall full application more like mix between pseudocode and actual code This is the initial stage of starting the **Execute** phase of the design))
